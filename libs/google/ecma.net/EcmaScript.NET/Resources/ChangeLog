	Ported Rhino fix for bug 386997 to EcmaScript.NET:
	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=386997

	Rhino Version 1.107 comment by nboyd:

		Fix bug 386997 - Need to support 'debugger' statement

		Adding the 'debugger' keyword will now result in a breakpoint being hit when
		run in the Rhino debugger. The statement is ignored if the debugger is not
		running or when compiled to Java bytecodes.

		Patch from Bob Jervis (bjervis@google.com).

    * First public release (based partly on Rhino 1.6R5)
    
    * Major Changes are:
    
        - Removed support for compiling javascript sources
        - Removed LiveConnect and replaced it with a new .NET layer 
          (See EcmaScript.NET.Types.Cli)
        - Rewrote E4X Support completely since it was based on
          javax.beans.* framework which has no counterpart in .NET.        
        - Added support JavaScript 1.5 getter and setter
        - .NET'ished some bits here and there (e.g. refactoring methods
          into properties and events)
